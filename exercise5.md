# Exercise 5
## Configurations
To implement the logger create a log4j2.xml file according to the template in the resources folder.

## Logging Libraries
Logging libraries offer a clean and useful way of logging infos. The main advantage
is the ability to log different levels, depending on the need. You can also define a certain pattern with 
automatic time and date logging and specify where to save the logs to.

## Loglevel
There are different levels on which you can log. Each level includes the levels below. The order is:
* ALL 
* TRACE 
* DEBUG 
* INFO 
* WARN 
* ERROR 
* FATAL
So if you were to use the error level you would get all logs on ERROR and FATAL.
## Possible Configurations
You can configure the logging level, choosing one from above. You can define the pattern
which the logging statements have and where they should be logged to. You can create more than one Logger and define different outputs.
